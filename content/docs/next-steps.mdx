title: Next Steps
---

Congrats, you've made it through the FarHack Hacking Guide! We hope that after going through this content you feel confident and prepared to build your first project on Farcaster.

If you're looking for some next steps, here are a few thing we suggest you try out:
- Find a cool project idea in the [/someone-build](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/someone-build) channel and vibecode your first mini app. Two templates you could quickly start from are [Moe's template on Val Town](https://www.val.town/x/moe/MiniAppStarter) and the [create-mini-app CLI from Farcaster](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/miniapps/tree/main/packages/create-mini-app).
- If you already have a project on Farcaster, share it in a cast! Feel free to post it in top channels and developer group chats, and if you tag `@farhack` we'd also be happy to help amplify your project
