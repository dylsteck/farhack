title: Participating in FarHack
---

This document is meant to serve as a manual for participating in FarHack and will go over everything from joining a hackathon to inviting teammates to submitting your first project.

## Creating a hackathon team

![Hackathons list on FarHack](https://i.imgur.com/fOKatPd.png)

All of our previous and upcoming hackathons can be [found here](/hackathons). Once you click into any of the hackathons, you'll be navigated to its dedicated homepage where you can view if the hackathon is still active, what the prizes and other teams are, and most importantly create/join a team.

**To create your own team from scratch:**
- Click on one of the active hackathons
- Either navigate to the "Your Team" tab and click "Create Team" or hit "Create Team" directly from the hackathon's homepage

<Callout title="Note">
    Hitting "Create Team" doesn't mean you've submitted your final project(don't worry you'll still have time for that!), it just lets you start preparing your team's final submission and gives the hackathon organizers a better sense of who is participating.
</Callout>

Once your team is created, you'll be able to use the "Your Team" page to edit/submit your hackathon project and invite/remove teammates.

## Accepting a hackathon team invite

If you have been invited to a hackathon team, you would have been notified in three possible ways(most likely the first two):
- Via a mini app notification in [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com)
- Via a direct cast in Warpcast
- Via a personal message(eg. your friend who invited you manually sent you the link on iMessage)

Once you have receieved the link/notification, you should be able to click on it and land directly on a page that shows you who's inviting you and lets you accept/decline the invite. Once you've accpeted the invite, the "Your Team" tab will list you as a member and let you edit project details.

## Learning about the hackathon's bounties and partners

All hackathons on FarHack have a set of bounties and partners who put up/sponsor those bounties. To view all of the bounties for the pariticular hackathon you're participating in, you can go to the "Bounties" tab for that hackathon's page and will see a page filled with all of the different bounties.

It's also worth noting that another great place to find out even more about the partners behind these bounties is on Farcaster directly! If a company, let's say [MBD](https://mbd.xyz) for example, has a bounty in a hackathon, it's likely that someone on their team will have threads expanding on the sorts of things they'd want to see built. This also opens opportunities for you to dive deeper into what that team does or even reach out to team members/the founder directly.

## Submitting your project

You're almost there, now it's time to submit your project for judging! 
Go to the "Your Team" tab and where it says "Edit", make sure you have all of the details filled out for your project:
- Name
- Description
- Bounties/Tracks
- Links

Once you have this all filled out, you should be able to hit the "Submit" button and then double confirm since submitting is an irreversible action.

Congrats! You've now submitted your first FarHack project and are well on your way to building amazing products in the Farcaster ecosystem, we hope to see you soon at another hackathon!
