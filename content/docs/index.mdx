Welcome to the **FarHack Hacking Guide**, a resource filled with potential hackathon ideas, rules of the road, community tools/docs, and everything else you'll need to get started hacking.

This is a resource you could read before participating in a FarHack, or even content to read if you want to start vibe coding Farcaster Mini Apps for the first time. Regardless, we want to set you up for success! 

Below is an overview of the Hacking Guide's different sections and what they contain, if this is your first time reading it we recommend going through each page in order.
