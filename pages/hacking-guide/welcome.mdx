We're so excited to welcome you to **FarHack at FarCon**, taking place from May 3 - 5 at [Chapter One](https://chapterone.com) in Santa Monica.
This is the ultimate Farcaster hackathon to learn how to build on Farcaster with Farcasters -- with ~36 hours to build and all the hands-on support you may need.

This website serves as a **Hacking Guide** -- from logsitical information such as hackathon scheduling and submitting your project, to learning about how to build on top of Farcaster

Have any questions along the way? Feel free to reach out to myself([@dylsteck.eth](https://warpcast.com/dylsteck.eth)) or cast in the [/farhack](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/farhack) channel on Warpcast and we will get back to you shortly!
